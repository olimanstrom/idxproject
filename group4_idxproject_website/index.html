                        <h2>The Invisuit</h2>
                        <p>
                            Through this project, we explore scenarios in which you might want 
                            to be invisible and go unnoticed by your smart home. Want to cheat? 
                            Sneak out? Have a midnight snack? Or just have some privacy? We ask ourselves 
                            about the future we can expect when we have smart home cameras with 
                            AI-powered human recognition integrated throughout our homes. 
                            - Think of the Invisuit as a way to safeguard your privacy in the future 
                            of smart homes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have created our very own invisibility suit, to allow you to freely and 
                            unnoticed live in your own home. The suit works by confusing the camera with 
                            light, patterns, and shapes.
                        </p>

                            The Invisuit is a critical design project, aiming criticism of smart home 
                            devices that surveil users through their own cameras. The Invisuit offers 
                            participants the opportunity to reflect on the data collection practices 
                            inherent in smart home surveillance systems.

                    <p>Throughout the Invisuit project, the machine learning library <a href="https://ml5js.org/">ml5.js’s</a> Body Segmentation model was used. 
                        This model identifies 24 different parts of the human body in near real-time.
                         The model was adapted and reworked to fit our project and was an important part of prototyping the suit. </p>

                        <p>Although the Invisuit makes you 'invisible' to the cameras, 
                            it doesn’t mean the surveillance stops. The cameras are still active, 
                            still collecting data, even if they fail to capture a clear image. 
                            This part of the experience is a metaphor for how smart home devices work. 
                            Even if their purpose isn't to see everything they do. 

                            In 2023 approximately 51% of Americans had smart home cameras in their home, 
                            and it is predicted to increase by 82,7% aka 81.84 million households worldwide, 
                            according to <a href="https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/smart-home-security-camera-market">Future Market Insights</a>.
